# Frontend

The **frontend** of the application was built with **React + Vite**.  
It allows the user to select a **JSON file** containing r√©sum√© and job description data, and send this file to the backend through the `/questions` endpoint.  
The API responds with a list of **customized questions** based on the provided r√©sum√© and job description.
